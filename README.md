The main way to use this app is to download the Expo go app on your mobile device and scan the QR code to start the app as it is not published yet. 
If you try to do it on web, some UI won't look how it's supposed to due to web hosting constraints.

pls use the Expo Go app available on Play Store, download it, scan the QR code and enjoy!
