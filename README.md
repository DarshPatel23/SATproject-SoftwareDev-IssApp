# PRO-C80-ISS-Tracker

Class 80 final code

The main way to use this app is to download the Expo go app on your mobile device and scan the QR code to start the app, as it is not published yet. 
If you try to do it on web some UI wont look how its supposed to due to web hosting constraints.

To get to this i have pasted the link below. open it in a new tab and select "My Device" on the preview options and then scan the QR code on your mobile device to run the app.
